Tikz templates for fancy latex figures

-----
Description
-----
This package contains the Tikz templates I have created since I started using it from 2017.01. 

It is indeed clean and good looking. But the time it took is much more than a WYSWYG tool. However modifying an existing template would greatly accelerate the process.
